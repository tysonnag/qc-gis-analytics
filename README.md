# qc-gis-analytics
End-to-end data analytics project combining SQL, Power BI, and GIS to analyze order density, service coverage, SLA performance, and site-level optimization in quick commerce operations.
# Quick Commerce GIS & Operations Analytics

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how data analytics, SQL, Power BI, and GIS-based
analysis can be used to optimize service coverage, improve SLA performance,
and balance operational load across multiple quick commerce sites.

## Business Problem
Quick commerce sites often face overlapping service areas, uneven order
distribution, and SLA breaches due to inefficient geo-mapping and routing.
This project analyzes order density, site polygons, and delivery metrics to
identify optimization opportunities.

## Data & Metrics
- Order latitude and longitude
- Site codes and service polygons
- OTI, ITR, RTD, OTD time metrics
- SLA thresholds and performance indicators

## Analysis Performed
- GIS polygon and radius-based coverage analysis
- Order density and overlap identification
- SLA and delivery performance analysis
- Pre vs post remapping comparison

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (business metrics & aggregations)
- Power BI (dashboards, DAX, Power Query)
- GIS (polygons, radius mapping, geo-visualization)
- Excel (data preparation)

## Business Impact
- Improved visibility into service coverage
- Identification of overlap and leakage zones
- Data-driven insights for operational optimization
