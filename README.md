# qc-gis-analytics
End-to-end data analytics project combining SQL, Power BI, and GIS to analyze order density, service coverage, SLA performance, and site-level optimization in quick commerce operations.
# Quick Commerce GIS & Operations Analytics

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how data analytics, SQL, Power BI, and GIS-based
analysis can be used to optimize service coverage, improve SLA performance,
and balance operational load across multiple quick commerce sites.

## Business Problem
Quick commerce sites often face overlapping service areas, uneven order
distribution, and SLA breaches due to inefficient geo-mapping and routing.
This project analyzes order density, site polygons, and delivery metrics to
identify optimization opportunities.

## Key Business Questions
- Are QC site service polygons overlapping and causing order leakage?
- Which geographic zones have high order density but poor SLA performance?
- Is the current radius-based coverage aligned with demand patterns?
- How can polygon remapping improve site-level load balancing and delivery speed?

## Data & Metrics
- Order latitude and longitude
- Site codes and service polygons
- OTI, ITR, RTD, OTD time metrics
- SLA thresholds and performance indicators

## Analysis Performed
- GIS polygon and radius-based coverage analysis
- Order density and overlap identification
- SLA and delivery performance analysis
- Pre vs post remapping comparison

## Before vs After Geo-Remapping Analysis
This analysis compares operational performance before and after
geo-polygon remapping to evaluate changes in order distribution,
service coverage efficiency, and SLA compliance.

The comparison helps identify whether remapping actions led to
better demand alignment and reduced overlap between QC sites.
